# Advanced To Do App

The project is focused on creating a well-known To-Do Web Application. But there will be some additional features available, that are going to make it stand out from your typical To Do App done by following a simple tutorial. The project's goal is to challenge me so that I can learn new solutions & technologies, in the end creating a little bit more advanced app.

Tech stack: Django, DRF, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS,

Planned features:
calendar available to plan future tasks and see past tasks
simple CRUD logic of to-do tasks (done)
to-do tasks sorted into different categories
cloud solution
trigger for weekly e-mail reports with statistics
authentication system
availability to generate daily/weekly/monthly reports
achievements system - synced with current date

Implemented features:
* CRUD for tasks on backend side (tested with Postman)
* Django integrated with PostegreSQL

Current to-do:
- add category
- add set of available status values
- link each task to list
- pick frontend technology
- add simple frontend
